"""
anomaly_detector_case.py - Project script (example).

Author: Denise Case
Date: 2026-03-07

Static Data

- Data is taken from a pediatric clinic's patient records.
- The data is static, meaning it does not change over time and is not updated with new records.
- The clinic works with children from birth to 16 years old.
- Each row represents a patient visit with two key measurements:
  - age_years: The patient's age in years.
  - height_inches: The patient's height in inches.

Purpose

- Read the data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file.
- Detect anomalies.
- Log the pipeline process to assist with debugging and transparency.

Paths (relative to repo root)

    INPUT FILE: data/clinic_data_case.csv
    OUTPUT FILE: artifacts/anomalies_case.csv

Terminal command to run this file from the root project folder

    uv run python -m cintel.anomaly_detector_case

OBS:
  Don't edit this file - it should remain a working example.
  Use as much of this code as you can when creating your own pipeline script,
  and change the logic to detect anomalies and define thresholds as needed for your project.

    # ----------------------------------------------------
    # STEP 1: READ CSV DATA FILE INTO A POLARS DATAFRAME (TABLE)
    # ----------------------------------------------------
    # Polars is great for tabular data.
    # We will use the polars package to
    # read csv (comma-separated values) files
    # into a two dimensional table (DataFrame).

    # Call the polars library read_csv() method.
    # Pass in (provide) the DATA_FILE path of the CSV file.
    # Name the result "df" as is customary.
    df: pl.DataFrame = pl.read_csv(DATA_FILE)

    # Visually inspect the file in the data/ folder.
    # It has columns named `age_years` and `height_inches`.
    # The DataFrame height attribute returns the number of rows.
    LOG.info(f"Loaded {df.height} patient records")

    # ----------------------------------------------------
    # STEP 2: DEFINE THRESHOLDS AND DETECT ANOMALIES
    # ----------------------------------------------------
    # An anomaly is any value greater than the threshold we set.
    # Domain rule for this example:
    # Anything above this value is suspicious.
    LOG.info("Studying children's ages and heights to find anomalies...")

    # x is age in years, so 16 is the upper limit for kids
    MAX_REASONABLE_X_VALUE: Final[float] = 16.0

    # y is height in inches, so maybe 6 feet (72 inches) is a reasonable upper limit
    MAX_REASONABLE_Y_VALUE: Final[float] = 72.0

    LOG.info(f"MAX_REASONABLE_X_VALUE: {MAX_REASONABLE_X_VALUE} in years")
    LOG.info(f"MAX_REASONABLE_Y_VALUE: {MAX_REASONABLE_Y_VALUE} in inches")

    # Create a new DataFrame named anomalies_df that contains
    # only the rows where EITHER
    # the age is TOO HIGH OR
    # the height is TOO HIGH.
    # A single pipe (|) is the OR operator in polars.
    # We will use greater than or equal to (>=) to find values at or above the threshold.
    anomalies_df: pl.DataFrame = df.filter(
        (pl.col("age_years") >= MAX_REASONABLE_X_VALUE)
        | (pl.col("height_inches") >= MAX_REASONABLE_Y_VALUE)
    )

    LOG.info(f"Count of anomalies found: {anomalies_df.height}")

    # ----------------------------------------------------
    # STEP 3: SAVE THE OUTPUT ANOMALIES AS EVIDENCE
    # ----------------------------------------------------
    # We call generated files "artifacts".
    # They are important evidence of the work we did and the results we found.
    # We will save the anomalies_df DataFrame as a CSV file in the artifacts/ folder

    # Every Polars DataFrame has a write_csv() method that saves it as a CSV file.
    # Just pass in the full Path to the file you want to create.
